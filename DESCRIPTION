Description: The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) 
    is a ground segment of the European Organization for the Exploitation of 
    Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and one of EUMETSATs Satellite Application 
    Facilities. The CM SAF contributes to the sustainable observing of the climate 
    system by providing essential climate variables related to the energy and water 
    cycle of the atmosphere (<http://www.cmsaf.eu>). It is a joint cooperation of seven 
    National Meteorological and Hydrological Services.
    The 'cmsaf' R-package provides a collection of R-operators for the analysis and 
    manipulation of CM SAF NetCDF formatted data. The 'cmsaf' R-package is tested 
    for CM SAF NetCDF data, which are structured in three-dimensional arrays 
    (longitude, latitude, time) on a rectangular grid. Layered CM SAF data have to 
    be converted with the provided levbox_mergetime() function. The 'cmsaf' R-package 
    operators have only minor checks for deviations from the recommended data structure, 
    and give only few specific error messages.
    Scripts for an easy application of the 'cmsaf' package operators and the preparation
    and visualization of CM SAF NetCDF data are provided at the CM SAF webpage 
    (<http://www.cmsaf.eu/EN/Products/Tools/Tools_node.html>).
